# Gas Blender

## Introduction
We are 6 students on Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola currently going the Project in Systemtechnic course an part of this course was to solve an actual problem or request. For this request we were tasked with building an app for gas blending and you will find all all our files here.

## Architecture Overview
In the backend folder we have all the python files used for the backend of the app.
In the kv folder we have all the kivy files used for the frontend of the app.
In the pic folder we have all the pictures used by the kv folder in the frontend of the app.
In the test folder we have python code for unittests and just regular tests for the different parts of the app.
Outside the folders we have the programs that will tie it all together.

## How to Use
1. Download the folder of the "builds" branch linked here: https://github.com/Skymtes/Systemteknik/tree/builds
2. Open the file and locate the main.exe in the main folder and run that file.
3. Done.

### Build
Download all the files. Download all the dependencies. Run the main.py file and the app should work. 
You can also use the exe file in the builds branch for easy direct access to the app.

### Test
Download the files and run the db_test.py file in the test folder to run tests for the database.
Download the files and run the test_belnding.py file in the test folder to run tests for the beldningg algorithm.
Do `python3 -m unittest discover` to run all the tests.
